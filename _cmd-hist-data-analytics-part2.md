PRRP-001

Please help me to fill an assesment from AWS for applying for Analytics Competency Program:
The request is as follows:
"Supply and Demand
AWS Partner ensures that capacity matches but does not exceed what is needed, including by using a demand-based, buffer-based, or time-based approach.

Please provide the following as evidence:

* A description of capacity planning activities, including testing for demand at scale.
"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Capacity planning is meticulously carried out using a base resource and testing performance, scaling and data needs.. across many anticipated input workloads. The results are carefully analyzed to arrive at the optimum cost effective option that not sacrifice critical business factors.
Testing is done iteratively across varied resources to collect metrics and narrow down decision.

Matrix to show the optimization path - how do we right size .. what is the approach? - Mohammed can demo"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! I'll enhance the capacity planning activities description with fictitious values and numbers to provide a more detailed and quantifiable perspective.

---

### **Enhanced Capacity Planning Activities Description with Real Case Scenario**

#### **1. Demand-Based Capacity Planning:**

* **Usage Monitoring and Analysis:**
  * Monitoring metrics such as CPU usage averaging 60%, with spikes up to 80% during peak hours.
* **Predictive Analysis:**
  * Analyzing past 6-month data showing a 20% increase in demand quarter-over-quarter.
* **Scalability Testing:**
  * Load testing simulated 10,000 concurrent users, revealing a need for a 30% increase in instance capacity during peak periods.

#### **2. Buffer-Based Capacity Planning:**

* **Buffer Strategy:**
  * Maintaining a buffer capacity of 15% above average peak demand.
* **Auto Scaling Configuration:**
  * Auto Scaling set to trigger an increase in instances when CPU usage consistently exceeds 70%, and decrease when usage falls below 50%.

#### **3. Time-Based Capacity Planning:**

* **Scheduled Scaling:**
  * Increasing instance count by 25% during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM) based on historical usage patterns.
* **Event-Driven Scaling:**
  * For an anticipated marketing event, scaling up capacity by 40% to handle expected traffic surge.

#### **4. Testing for Demand at Scale:**

* **Load Testing:**
  * Load testing with 15,000 virtual users showed a response time increase from 2 seconds to 5 seconds, prompting an adjustment in scaling strategy.
* **Stress Testing:**
  * Stress tests indicated the system could handle up to 20,000 concurrent users before experiencing significant degradation.
* **Test Environments:**
  * Deployed three separate test environments using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, mirroring the production setup.

#### **5. Continuous Improvement:**

* **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
  * Quarterly reviews resulted in a 10% adjustment in auto-scaling policies to better align with changing usage patterns.
* **Feedback Loop:**
  * Monthly performance reports are analyzed to refine capacity planning strategies, with a focus on optimizing cost while maintaining performance.

ACCT-002

Please help me to fill an assesment from AWS for applying for Analytics Competency Program. I am interested to provide the evidence requested containing some concrete examples of how we did this for our client Toshiba. The request in the assesment is as follows:

"Define identity security best practice on how to access customer environment by leveraging IAM

Define standard approach to access customer-owned AWS accounts, including:

* Both AWS Management Console access and programmatic access using the AWS Command Line Interface or other custom tools.
* When and how to use temporary credentials such as IAM roles
* Leverage customer's existing enterprise user identities and their credentials to access AWS services through Identity Federation or migrating to AWS Managed Active Directory

Establish best practices around  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and other identity and access management systems, including:

* IAM principals are only granted the minimum privileges necessary. Wildcards in Action and Resource elements should be avoided as much as possible.
* Every AWS Partner individual who accesses an AWS account must do so using dedicated credentials

Please provide the following as evidence:

* Security engagement Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) which met all the 2 criteria defined above. Acceptable evidence types are: security training documents, internal wikis, standard operating procedures documents. Written descriptions in the self-assessment excel is not acceptable.
* Description of how IAM best practices are implemented in one (1) of the submitted customer examples.

"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"IAM roles were used to provide programmatic access to AWS resources for the customer's development team. These roles were configured with precise permissions, ensuring that team members only had access to the resources necessary for their tasks.
For AWS Management Console access, we integrated the customer's on-premises Active Directory with AWS using AWS Managed Active Directory. This allowed users to sign in using their existing corporate credentials, enhancing both security and user convenience.
Dedicated IAM credentials were provisioned for our team members involved in the project, ensuring that their access was limited to their specific responsibilities within the customer's AWS account.
This implementation not only enhanced identity security but also streamlined access management for the customer's AWS resources.

In conclusion, our identity security best practices are well-documented in our Security Engagement SOP, and we have successfully implemented these practices in real-world customer engagements. These practices are aligned with our commitment to securing customer environments while adhering to AWS best practices.

Evidence Provided:

Security Engagement Standard Operation Procedure (SOP):

We have developed a comprehensive Security Engagement SOP that meets the criteria outlined above. This SOP serves as our internal guide for identity security best practices when accessing customer-owned AWS accounts. It includes detailed procedures for setting up IAM roles, integrating with existing enterprise identities, and adhering to the principle of least privilege."
