**Identity Security Best Practices for Accessing Customer Environment using IAM**

**1. AWS Management Console and Programmatic Access:**

- **IAM Users**:

  - Create individual IAM users for each person who requires access. Avoid using the root account.
  - Assign users to IAM groups with defined permissions, rather than assigning permissions directly to individual users.
  - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users, especially those with console access.

- **Programmatic Access**:
  - For applications or automated tools, use IAM roles instead of sharing access and secret keys.
  - Rotate access keys regularly and avoid embedding them in code. Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager.
  - If using AWS CLI, configure named profiles for different AWS accounts or roles.

**2. Temporary Credentials and IAM Roles:**

- **IAM Roles**:

  - Use IAM roles for cross-account access. This allows users or services in one AWS account to access resources in another.
  - Use IAM roles for EC2 instances. This provides temporary credentials to applications running on the instance without exposing access keys.
  - Rotate role session tokens regularly.

- **Security Token Service (STS)**:
  - Use AWS STS to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or for users from another identity source.

**3. Identity Federation and AWS Managed Active Directory:**

- **Identity Federation**:

  - Integrate IAM with identity providers (IdP) like Microsoft Active Directory using SAML 2.0. This allows users to sign in to the AWS Management Console using their existing corporate credentials.
  - For mobile or custom applications, use Amazon Cognito, which can federate with external identity providers.

- **AWS Managed Active Directory**:
  - If the customer is using Microsoft AD, consider integrating with AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory. This managed service allows you to connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory or set up a new, standalone directory in the AWS Cloud.
  - Users can use their existing AD credentials to access AWS services like Amazon RDS and Amazon EC2.

**4. General Best Practices:**

- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**:

  - Always grant only the permissions necessary to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary.

- **Regular Audits**:

  - Regularly review and audit IAM roles, policies, and credentials to ensure compliance with security best practices.
  - Use AWS CloudTrail to log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.

- **Password Policies**:
  - Enforce strong password policies for IAM users, such as minimum length, complexity requirements, and rotation policies.
