## **Evidence: Automation of Deployment and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**

**Written Description:**

At PREDICTif., we've recognized the immense benefits that come from infrastructure automation, both in terms of speed and reliability. We have thus established a strict policy against manual changes in our production environment via the AWS Management Console. Instead, we've embraced Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using AWS CloudFormation for consistent, reproducible, and scalable infrastructure deployments.

Our process starts with developers writing CloudFormation templates for any infrastructure needs. These templates are stored in a version-controlled repository. A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline validates and deploys these templates to the AWS environment. This ensures all changes are documented, tested, and can be reproduced across various stages of our environment (dev, test, prod).

**Example CloudFormation Template:**

This CloudFormation script establishes a new DynamoDB table:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyDynamoDBTable:
    Type: 'AWS::DynamoDB::Table'
    Properties:
      TableName: 'UserProfiles'
      AttributeDefinitions:
        -
          AttributeName: 'UserID'
          AttributeType: 'S'
      KeySchema:
        -
          AttributeName: 'UserID'
          KeyType: 'HASH'
      ProvisionedThroughput:
        ReadCapacityUnits: '5'
        WriteCapacityUnits: '5'
```

+---------+     +---------+     +----------------+       +--------------+
```

1. Developers push CloudFormation templates to a GitHub repository.
2. Jenkins CI server detects changes and pulls the latest template.
3. CloudFormation reads the template, understands the desired state, and deploys resources (e.g., a DynamoDB table).
4. The desired infrastructure (DynamoDB in this example) is created or updated based on the template.
