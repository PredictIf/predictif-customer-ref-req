## **Developing Workload Health KPIs for AWS Environments**

### **Objective**
To ensure consistent and proactive monitoring of customer workloads, it's crucial to define, collect, and analyze health metrics. This document provides guidance on establishing workload health KPIs using AWS services or third-party tools.

### **1. Defining, Collecting, and Analyzing Workload Health Metrics**

#### **1.1. AWS Services**

- **Amazon CloudWatch**:
  - **Definition**: Identify key metrics relevant to your workload. This could include CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and more.
  - **Collection**: Use CloudWatch to automatically collect and store these metrics.
  - **Analysis**: Create CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize and analyze these metrics.

- **Amazon CloudTrail**:
  - **Definition**: Identify API call-based metrics or patterns that indicate workload health.
  - **Collection**: CloudTrail captures API calls made on your account.
  - **Analysis**: Use query features to analyze logs for patterns.

#### **1.2. Third-Party Tools**

- Tools like Datadog, New Relic, and Splunk can be integrated with AWS.
- Define and collect metrics using the tool's interface.
- Analyze metrics using the tool's dashboard and reporting features.

### **2. Exporting Standard Application Logs**

#### **2.1. AWS Services**

- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**:
  - Integrate application logging with CloudWatch Logs.
  - Ensure logs capture errors, warnings, and other significant events.
  - Use Log Insights for querying and analyzing log data.

- **AWS Lambda**:
  - For serverless applications, ensure that you're logging relevant events using the provided logging library (e.g., `console.log` in Node.js).

#### **2.2. Third-Party Tools**

- Integrate application logging with tools like Loggly, Splunk, or ELK Stack.
- Ensure logs capture relevant information, especially errors.

### **3. Defining Thresholds for Operational Metrics**

#### **3.1. AWS Services**

- **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms**:
  - Create alarms for specific metrics.
  - Define thresholds that, when breached, will trigger the alarm.
  - Integrate with **Amazon SNS** to send notifications when an alarm is triggered.

#### **3.2. Third-Party Tools**

- Use the alerting feature of your tool to set up alerts based on defined thresholds.
- Ensure notifications are set up to inform relevant stakeholders.

### **Best Practices**

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review the KPIs to ensure they remain relevant.
2. **Documentation**: Document any custom metrics or logs to ensure clarity for all team members.
3. **Security**: Ensure that any metrics or logs collected do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Use insights from metrics and logs to inform workload improvements.

### **Conclusion**
By following this guidance, teams can ensure they have a comprehensive view of their workload's health, enabling proactive issue detection and resolution.
