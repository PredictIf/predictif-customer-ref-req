### Customer Example: Stress Engineering Services.

**Background**: Stress Engineering Services. is a healthcare technology company that provides cloud-based solutions for hospitals and clinics. They handle sensitive patient data and are subject to strict compliance regulations.

### Secure AWS Account Governance Implementation:

1. **AWS Organizations**:
    - Stress Engineering Services. uses AWS Organizations to centrally manage multiple AWS accounts. This allows them to apply service control policies (SCPs) at the organization level, ensuring consistent security policies across all accounts.

2. **Account Structure**:
    - Separate AWS accounts are created for different environments like Development, Testing, Staging, and Production. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and reduces the blast radius in case of security incidents.

3. **IAM Policies and Roles**:
    - Custom IAM policies are created following the principle of least privilege. Users and services only get the permissions they absolutely need.
    - Roles are used for cross-account access, ensuring that services in one account can access resources in another without the need for long-term credentials.

4. **MFA and Password Policies**:
    - MFA is enforced for all IAM users, especially those with elevated permissions.
    - Strong password policies are in place, requiring complex passwords that are rotated regularly.

5. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**:
    - SCPs are used to restrict services that are not required for Stress Engineering Services.'s operations. For instance, if they don't operate in certain regions, those regions are blacklisted using SCPs.

6. **CloudTrail and Config**:
    - AWS CloudTrail is enabled in all accounts and regions, with logs centralized in a secure S3 bucket in the master account.
    - AWS Config is used to continuously monitor and record configuration changes, ensuring that any drift from the baseline is immediately detected.

7. **GuardDuty and Security Hub**:
    - AWS GuardDuty is enabled for continuous threat detection and monitoring.
    - AWS Security Hub is used to aggregate security alerts and findings from various AWS services, providing a centralized view of security posture.

8. **Regular Audits**:
    - Stress Engineering Services. conducts regular third-party audits of their AWS environment to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.
    - Automated compliance checks are performed using tools like AWS Config Rules and custom Lambda functions.

9. **Incident Response Plan**:
    - A well-defined incident response plan is in place, ensuring that any security incidents are promptly addressed. This includes predefined communication channels, roles, and responsibilities.

10. **Training and Awareness**:
    - All employees undergo regular AWS security training, ensuring they are aware of best practices and the latest threats.

### Conclusion:
Stress Engineering Services. has implemented a robust AWS Account Governance strategy, ensuring that their patient data is secure and they remain compliant with healthcare regulations. By leveraging AWS's native security tools and following best practices, they maintain a strong security posture in the cloud.
